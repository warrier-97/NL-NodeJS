/**
 * Promises were introduced in ES2015 (ES6) - they are also called "thenables"
 * 
 * A Promise object represents the future result of an asynchronous operation. A promise can be in one of three states - pending, fulfilled (aka resolved) or rejected. A promise is said to be settled if it is either fulfilled or rejected. Each of these represents the state of an expected event of interest.
 * 
 * Promises simplify code involving multiple asynchronous operation by
 * 1. Avoiding nesting of callbacks (referred to as callback hell/Christmas tree problem)
 * 2. Supports execution of resolve/reject handlers even when corresponding event has completed in the past
 * 3. Supports multiple resolve/reject handlers
 * 4. Supports chaining of method calls
 * 5. Has constructs for synchronizing multiple asynchronous operations
