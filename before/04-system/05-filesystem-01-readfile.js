/**
 * The fs module gives acceess to the filesystem via methods that usually have noth a synchronous and an asynchronous version
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Require 'fs' module
 * 2. Use readFileSync() to read file synchronously (pass encoding type 'utf8' to get string instead of buffer. Synchronous methods should ideally be enclosed in a try..catch as they can throw errors.
 * 3. Do the same with readFile() with callback -- this is the way file should be read
