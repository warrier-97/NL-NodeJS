/**
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Require the http module
 * 2.1 Create a server using http module's createServer() method
 * 2.2 Add a 'request' event listener to the server - pass it a request-reponse handler. Use the ServerResponse object (req) to end the request with a message (use req.end())
 * 3.1 Use server's listen method to start the server and make it listen on a given port (use environment variable PORT if present)
 * 3.2 Make sure the server started by handling the 'listening' event and passing a callback
