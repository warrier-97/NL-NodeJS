/**
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Require the http module
 * 2.1 Create a server using http module's createServer() method - pass it a request-reponse handler.
 * 2.2 Use the ServerResponse object (req) to end the request with a message (use req.end())
 * 3. Use server's listen method to start the server and make it listen on a given port (use environment variable PORT if present) - make sure the server started by passing a callback (which is internally set for the 'listening' event)
