/**
 * Even json files can be required
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Require './05-require-json.json', and log the "require"d value.
 *
 * Note: Node first tries to resolve to .js extension, then .json - so the .json is needed in this case (not including the extension, this file and the json file share the same name)
