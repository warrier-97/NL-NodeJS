/**
 * describe() can be used to create groupd of tests as well as sub-groups - simply nest the describe() calls.
 * Instructions:
 * Group all tests from last 2 exercises into groups and sub-groups. For example, create 2 main groups
 * 1. predicate function tests
 * 2. operator tests
 * And then 2 sub-groups for operator tests
 * 2.1 test sum function (incorrect setup for demo)
 * 2.2 test sum function (correct setup for demo)
